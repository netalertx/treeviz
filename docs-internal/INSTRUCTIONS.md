# Always do

- read and follow the `docs-internal/INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Operational

- read the `docs-internal` folder contents (only keep important info in context to prevent bloat)
- place ad-hoc queries into the `adhoc_queries` folder, not root
- ask me to review before going to each next step (mention n step out of x)

- before starting, prepare implementation plan

- ask me to review it and ask any clarifying questions first
- update the `docs-internal` folder contents if learnings discovered
- use `adhoc_` folders for scripts or queries that are not used in migration or regular operation
- use `docs-fix-implementation-results` for any random .md docs not useful for regular operation, just for summaries etc.

## Code quality

- add test creation as last step - follow repo architecture patterns
- code has to be maintainable, no duplicate code
- follow DRY principle
- code files should be less than 500 LOC for better maintainability

# Tasks
